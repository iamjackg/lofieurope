# lo-fi europe

This is the code for <https://lofieurope.com>. The website is a collection of annotated images drawn by users of [r/europe](https://reddit.com/r/europe) on Reddit.

Inspired by the "lo-fi girl" from [lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A), the subreddit started a challenge for each country to make their own version of the drawing.

Each image ended up containing really cool tidbits and references to local pop culture, so I thought I'd start a crowdsourced effort to annotate all the images. It seemed like a really fun way to learn about other European countries.

Yeah, the code's not great. I put this together in a few hours.
